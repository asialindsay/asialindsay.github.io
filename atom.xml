<p>Breaking into the New York tech scene isn’t as hard as it sounds</p>

<p>My journey into tech wasn’t clear cut. I started my career as a linguist for TED, and while I was there I started the TED Coding Club with one of the web developers, Alex Dean. I rallied the people on the ground and he Skyped in from South Dakota to help with the technical questions- it was awesome!</p>

<p>After that I realized there was something in coding and it was worth looking into. The problem was bootcamps are expensive and it’s a pretty huge decision to make, so I looked to the community to learn more.</p>

<p>I just started asking around- I found people on LinkedIn who had done the General Assembly intensive course and asked what they thought of it. I signed up for a tonne of newsletters and started going to events. At first it felt a little odd as I didn’t know much about coding, but I got to the stage where I was beginning to bump into people I knew at events- it’s a really warm community, especially for women.</p>

<p>Scholarships, scholarships, scholarships - they are out there. There are definitely more for women but I’ve seen some for men too. Take full advantage of these. Girl Develop It sends out weekly emails with coding opportunities and job offers and more often than not, a scholarship or discount chucked in for good measure. Through this I got a place to go to the Google Women Techmakers Summit and was offered a discount for Lesbians Who Tech. I also got won the women’s scholarship to learn Rails from the lovely people at One Month- they give away 10 scholarships per month.</p>

<p>My mentor, Rebecca Garcia, has also been an invaluable resource- she’s helped me navigate the waters of applying to multiple bootcamps and invites me along to events with her.</p>

<p>Lastly, short courses, meetups and hackathons- more and more are cropping up every day. Women Who Code, Ladies Who Code and Hacker Hours are all excellent resources. Volunteering is great practise because it reinforces your own coding knowledge. My mentor also turned me onto CoderDojo NYC, a group she runs that teaches kids from 7 to 17 about web, game and app development.</p>

<p>There’s a lot out there- you just have to start looking. Check out this post for more resources.</p>
